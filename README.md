# To Do List

A to-do list is a list of things a person wants to do or has to do. He/she writes them down on a sheet of paper, and once the tasks are done, they cross them out; this is a common thing for busy people.
Now, I decided to turn the whole thing online by molding the idea into a website which will perform all of the functions noted above, as well as some other functions like alarms and all.

This is still under development, and requires a few more ideas to make it look better, or for beter functioning. I made it using HTML, JS and CSS all in one file 'index.html' since I got severely lazy.
Anyways, enjoy your tasks (not so much) with this, and make sure to not slack off!

Cheers, coders!
